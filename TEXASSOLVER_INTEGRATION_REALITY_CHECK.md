# TexasSolver Integration Reality Check
## August 19, 2025

### CRITICAL FINDINGS:

**1. ENVIRONMENT LIMITATIONS:**
- Downloads disappear during Replit workflow restarts
- Binary executables cannot be persistently stored 
- OpenSpiel CFR causes process termination errors
- No wget/unzip tools in standard environment

**2. TEXASSOLVER REQUIREMENTS:**
- TexasSolver is a 16MB+ C++ executable that needs:
  - Persistent file system access
  - Ability to run Linux binaries
  - Stable process execution environment
  - Memory allocation for CFR computations

**3. ATTEMPTED SOLUTIONS:**
- ✅ Successfully accessed GitHub API and found correct download URLs
- ✅ Downloaded TexasSolver v0.2.0 Linux version (16.8MB)
- ❌ Files vanish during environment restarts
- ❌ OpenSpiel CFR solver causes process crashes
- ❌ Cannot maintain persistent binary installation

### HONEST ASSESSMENT:

**The Replit environment appears incompatible with:**
1. Persistent binary executable storage
2. External solver integration requiring file system stability
3. Long-running CFR computations that don't crash processes

### VIABLE ALTERNATIVES:

**Option A: OpenSpiel CFR (if process issues can be resolved)**
- Real CFR algorithm implementation
- Already integrated but causing crashes
- Would provide authentic GTO calculations

**Option B: Acknowledge System Limitations** 
- Focus on computer vision and table detection
- Use rule-based heuristics with transparent labeling
- No misleading "GTO solver" claims

**Option C: External API Integration**
- Connect to cloud-hosted TexasSolver instance
- Requires user to provide API access to external solver
- Maintains authenticity requirement

### RECOMMENDATION:
Stop attempting TexasSolver binary integration in this environment.
Choose realistic path forward based on actual technical constraints.
