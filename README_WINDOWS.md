1. **First Time Setup**:
   ```
   Double-click: setup_windows.bat
   ```

2. **Daily Use**:
   ```
   Double-click: start_poker_advisor.bat
   ```

3. **Fast Start** (if already set up):
   ```
   Double-click: quick_start.bat
   ```

## What Each File Does

### `setup_windows.bat`
- **Use**: First-time installation only
- **What it does**: 
  - Creates virtual environment
  - Installs all Python dependencies
  - Sets up OCR engines (EasyOCR + Tesseract)
  - Downloads browser automation tools
  - Tests everything works
- **Time**: 5-15 minutes depending on internet speed

### `start_poker_advisor.bat`
- **Use**: Daily startup with dependency checking
- **What it does**:
  - Checks Python and dependencies
  - Installs any missing packages
  - Activates virtual environment
  - Starts the poker advisory server
- **Time**: 30-60 seconds

### `quick_start.bat`
- **Use**: Fast startup when everything is already working
- **What it does**:
  - Activates virtual environment
  - Starts server immediately
- **Time**: 5-10 seconds

## Requirements

### Mandatory
- **Windows 10/11**
- **Python 3.8+** from [python.org](https://python.org)
  - ⚠️ Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation

### Recommended (for maximum accuracy)
- **Tesseract OCR**: [Download here](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
  - Install to: `C:\Program Files\Tesseract-OCR`
  - Add to Windows PATH
  - System works without this (uses EasyOCR fallback)

## Using the System

### 1. Access Main Interface
Open browser to: `http://localhost:5000/unified`

### 2. Test Computer Vision
- Click "Capture Screenshot"
- Verify system can see your screen
- Test OCR text recognition

### 3. ACR Integration
- Open ACR poker client
- Join a poker table
- Use auto-advisory features for live analysis

### 4. Manual GTO Analysis
- Input poker situations manually
- Get mathematical GTO recommendations
- Review detailed strategy explanations

## Troubleshooting

### "Python not found"
- Install Python from python.org
- Make sure "Add Python to PATH" was checked
- Restart command prompt

### "Virtual environment failed"
- Run as administrator
- Check disk space (need ~2GB)
- Disable antivirus temporarily

### "Dependencies failed to install"
- Check internet connection
- Run as administrator
- Try: `pip install --upgrade pip`

### "Tesseract not found"
- System still works with EasyOCR
- For best accuracy, install Tesseract OCR
- Add installation folder to Windows PATH

### Server won't start
- Check if port 5000 is available
- Close other applications using the port
- Try different port: edit batch files
